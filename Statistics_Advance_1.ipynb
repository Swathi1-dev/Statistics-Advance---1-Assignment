        "\n",
        "Ans: A variable that takes numerical values based on outcomes of an random phenomenon.\n",
        "EG: while tossing a coin we have two values H(1) and T(0) , random variable will store 0 and 1 in it.\n",

        "3.  What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Discrete are countable values , finite data outcomes, continuos are infinite outcomes and it is uncountable.\n",

        "5.  How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: cumulative provides the distribution for all the probability and probability shows probability for specific values.\n",

        "6.  What is a discrete uniform distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: If the outcomes are discrete and all the probability is equal for all the outcomes then it is known as discrete uniform distribution.\n",
        "\n",

        "8.  What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: It have only 2 outcomes and n number of trails. it finds how many times we got specific outcome in n number of trails.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Poisson distribution is an type of mass function it finds the n number of events in an fixed interval , used in event count problems.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:  using mean , data and standard deviation we will found z-score . it shows how many SDs a vakue is form the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.  What are point estimates and interval estimates in statistics?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Point estimates give a single value and interval estimates give a range of valies.\n",

        "18.  What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: They provide a range within which the population parameter likely lies.\n",
